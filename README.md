# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Setup a new computer by doing the following:

- Install the languages and docker first using the scripts in `_scripts`
- Run `install_nvim.sh` which is dependent on the languages being available
- Run `gen_symlns.sh` to link the dotfiles
- Open `nvim` and run `:PlugInstall` and `:checkhealth`
